# Unicorn-Companies-Visualisation

## Description
The project aimed at exploring the relationships between Unicorn companies, their valuations, and funding. The dataset used contained information on Unicorn companies, including their name, industry, location, valuation, and funding. The data was cleaned and analyzed using various visualization tools from Python.

## Findings
Based on the findings, Fintech, Internet software and services, and E-commerce & direct-to-buyer are the biggest producers of Unicorn companies. North America and Asia are the hotspots for the companies in question. This could be useful information for investors when making decisions about their next investments.

## Data Cleaning
One thing that could have been done differently is how the data was cleaned. Maybe not adding the zeros during the removal of the $, B, and M signs in the valuation and funding columns. Other than that, the data seems to have been pretty easy to deal with.

## Future Project Ideas
With enough data or companies, one could try using machine learning to predict which companies have the potential to become Unicorn companies, which Unicorn companies are likely to fail, and perhaps even show the growth prospects of already existing Unicorn companies.

## PowerBI Dashboard
